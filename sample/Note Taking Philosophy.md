**How Does PARA Note Taking Work?**

Here’s a breakdown of each category:

- **Projects**: These are tasks that require multiple steps and have a specific goal or deadline. Examples might include planning an event, working on a project at work, or planning a vacation.
- **Areas**: These are aspects of your life that you want to maintain or improve, such as your health, finances, or relationships. You might have multiple areas, and each one might have its own set of notes and resources.
- **Resources**: These are things you need to refer to often, such as books, notes, or documents. You can store your resources in a note-taking app or digital tool.
