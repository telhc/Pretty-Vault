Here's what the above looks like in raw formatting
```
> [!note] This is a callout!
> You can put anything in here
>> [!note] Even another callout! 🪺
```

==IMPORTANT 💡==
You can edit them easily without the preview getting in your way by
- Right clicking it and hit edit or pressing the `</>` icon in the top right
- Use command palette with `cmd + p`
	- "Toggle live preview / source mode"
- Or maybe you've already configured this binding from [[Useful Hotkeys]]

# To Insert a Callout 💾

Either
- Use command palette with `cmd + p`
	- "Insert Callout" (⚠️ not "Admonition: Insert Callout" since it doesn't have autocomplete)
- Type out the raw formatting as explained above manually

⚠️ Note, if you're not getting an autocomplete when inserting your callouts, you might need to install [[Useful Plugins#Admonition ✨]]

# To Make Custom Callouts 🎨

Go to Settings > Admonition > Add New
![[Callout - Custom Admonition Callout.png]]
> Also yes you can paste images in like the above as well! Great for diaries and all

> [!custom] Tadda!✨
> Here's the custom callout we just made
