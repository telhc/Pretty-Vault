# On Organizing an Admin Workspace
PARA isÂ a note-taking framework that helps you organize your digital life by categorizing your information into four main categories: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. This framework is designed to be simple, useful, and flexible, making it easy to manage your notes and stay focused on what matters most.

**How Does PARA Note Taking Work?**

1. **Projects**: These are tasks that require more than one step to complete, such as planning an event or working on a long-term project.
2. **Areas**: These are aspects of your life that you want to maintain or improve, such as your health, finances, or relationships.
3. **Resources**: These are things you need to refer to often, such as books, notes, or documents.
4. **Archives**: These are completed projects or areas that you no longer need to actively work on.
