## About syncing

You can use Obsidian Sync with an account which is like $4 a month with an account, but I use Syncthing, though I believe it doesn't have an IOS app, I think [Resilio Sync on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resilio-sync/id1126282325) is largely similar if you want to do the syncing yourself.
