Just a guideline but your personal preference always prevails ofc 😉

# Setup Items 🪄

In no particular order

## Appearance 🎨
- Settings > Appearance > Font > Interface & Text Fonts 🔤
	- Note: If it's not applied after saving, it's probably not installed on the system, try another one!
- Settings > Appearance > Interface > **Inline Title OFF** 🎨
- Settings > Appearance > Themes > Manage > Install **Minimal Theme** 🎨
	- Configure the theme with [[Useful Plugins#Minimal Theme Settings 🖌️]]
	- Or just install another theme you like and ignore the plugin! (Note you can't use the settings plugin with )
