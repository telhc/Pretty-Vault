> - Reticularis (Latin) "net", Reticular Thalamic Nucleus|Reticulothalamic Cells wrap the Thalamus laterally
> - Receives input from the Cerebral Cortex and outputs to Dorsal Thalamic Nuclei via long axons stretching down
> - separated by External Medullary Lamina
> - Only thalamic cell that does not output to Cerebral Cortex
> - Puts ==attention== on specific thalamic areas by ==inhibition== (with ==queries== from Cerebral Cortex)
